#
> ## Overview
<p align="justify">
CoolCat will be a new way to store data at points in basically infinite larger or smaller node addresses. A form of hashing and key pairs to handshake and verify data locations. 
</p>

#
> ## Core Features Implemented

`Deployment on Chain`
- Tokenization of CoolCat addresses holding selected data.
- Initial Data sizes will allow up to 4.5mb image files (1000px x 1500px) 1,500,000px.
- model is an x,y,z axis model for vitual address known as VirtAdd with a subset or subsets for more detailed locations.
- These subsets are considered Depths and can be ongoing for initiall purposes, these Depths with max out at 12 layers (1100 Bin).
